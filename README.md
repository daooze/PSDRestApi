# PSDRestApi

The PSDRestAPI module is an extension for the great [PowerShell Deployment Extension Kit](https://github.com/FriendsOfMDT/PSD) to make RestAPI calls to a server running [RestPS](https://github.com/jpsider/RestPS). It includes a client-side module invoked by a PSDGather task and a "server endpoint" script invoked by the RestPS server.
